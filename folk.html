      <h3>MANIYARO</h3>
      <p>
          “MANIYARO” carries the sentiments of heroism in the RAAS of Maher community in Gujarat. Maniyaro does not possess a descending music tune unlike other folk songs, but it starts from the lower tempo and gradually
          ascends. The style and rhythm in which it is being sung and performed on, both are meant to be called
          MANIYARO. In the Saurashtra region of Gujarat,generally Men wear the traditional red & white costume, holding preset sized bamboo
          sticks known as "Dandiya". MANIYARO better suits with the musical combination of drums and
          flute.
